# Advent Of Code 2020

> Boilerplate forked from [tejasbusbane](https://github.com/tejasbubane/adventofcode-2020)

I'm learning Rust by solving the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

I'm a total [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) beginner and the code you see here is most likely not idiomatic Rust.
I haven't even finished _the book_.
I'd be happy about feedback on how to do something "_the Rust way_", feel free to raise issues on this repo.

### Usage

This is a library crate (no executable). Sample and puzzle inputs are hard-coded in tests.

Build project and run tests:

```bash
cargo test
# run only day1 tests + see println statements
cargo test day1 -- --nocapture
```
